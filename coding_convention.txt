The following outlines the coding convention that our team must follow:

Files will be in the following format
->header of the following format:
/* 
 * File:   filename.filetype
 * Author: Author Name (firstname lastname)
 * Created: Month Year
 * Version version number
 * Purpose: short description of file purpose and contents
*/

-> (if .hpp file) #ifndef FILENAME_HPP
                  #define FILENAME_HPP

-> followed by any import or include statements
-> followed by any #define statements
-> followed by class definition/implementation (if applicable)
-> followed by function definitions/implementations (if applicable)
-> (if .hpp file) #endif


Function definitions in the hpp file must be preceeded by a comment outlining the 
purpose of the function, ie what the function is meant to do

Function definitions should look like this:
-> return_type function_name(datatype1 parameter_1, // comment explaining parameter_1
                            datatype2 parameter_2 // comment explaining parameter_2
                            )

All variable/entity/function names must be good descriptive names, and when possible
should use the following naming convention:
-> word1_word2_word3
ie words should be seperated using underscores for legibility
